Intent: A discord bot I was designing as a moderation bot, not for formal use but as a personal project

I've deleted identifying information such as specific channel IDs and the Discord Bot's OAUTH Token

>fact() : gets a random fact
>count(@author) : counts the number of messages a specified user has sent in the channel
>prune(@author) : deletes all of a specified user's messages from the channel
>void() : deletes all messages in the channel
>whitelist(username, "add" or "remove") : adds or removes a player from the internal whitelist
>window(channel) : changes the bot's current channel to the new channel if the user is whitelisted
>log(channel) : saves all messages from a channel into a log file
>play() : plays a specific file in the voice channel the bot is connected to, at this time I don't remember what that audio file was
